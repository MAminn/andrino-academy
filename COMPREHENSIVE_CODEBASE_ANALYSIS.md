## 👥 ROLE-BASED ANALYSIS

### 1. 🎓 **STUDENT ROLE**

**Purpose**: Learner who attends sessions, tracks progress, views content

#### ✅ **What Students CAN Do:**

**Access & Viewing**

- ✅ View assigned grade and all tracks within it
- ✅ See upcoming sessions with instructor name
- ✅ Track attendance history (present/absent/late)
- ✅ View personal progress dashboard
- ✅ Join active sessions via external links

**Session Participation**

- ✅ Click "Join Now" when session is ACTIVE
- ✅ Opens Zoom/Meet/Teams in new tab automatically
- ✅ See live banner: "🔴 جلسة مباشرة الآن!" during active sessions
- ✅ View session materials/notes (when instructor adds them)

**Restrictions**

- ❌ Cannot self-enroll in grades/tracks (must pay first, then manager assigns)
- ❌ Cannot see other students' data
- ❌ Cannot access instructor/admin tools
- ❌ Cannot create or modify sessions
- ❌ Cannot mark their own attendance

#### 🔧 **Technical Implementation:**

**Dashboard Location**: `src/app/student/dashboard/page.tsx`

**API Access**:

```typescript
✅ GET /api/students/[id] - Own data only
✅ GET /api/sessions?studentId=[id] - Assigned sessions
✅ GET /api/attendance?studentId=[id] - Own attendance
❌ POST /api/students - Cannot create accounts themselves
```

**Data Flow**:

```
Manager assigns grade → Student.gradeId populated
→ Student dashboard queries Grade.tracks
→ Tracks include LiveSessions
→ Student sees all assigned content
```

**Critical Fix Applied** (Today):

- API returns `assignedGrade` but frontend expected `grade`
- **Fixed**: Added data transformation: `student.grade = student.assignedGrade`

---

### 2. 👨‍🏫 **INSTRUCTOR ROLE**

**Purpose**: Teaches tracks, manages sessions, marks attendance

#### ✅ **What Instructors CAN Do:**

**Track Management**

- ✅ View only tracks where `track.instructorId === user.id`
- ✅ See track details (grade, coordinator, student count)
- ✅ View all sessions for their tracks

**Session Management**

- ✅ Create new sessions for assigned tracks (via coordinator/manager)
- ✅ Add external meeting links (Zoom/Meet/Teams) to sessions
- ✅ **Cannot start sessions without valid external link** (enforced)

- ✅ Complete sessions (changes status to COMPLETED)
- ✅ Edit session details (title, description, time)

**Attendance Management**

- ✅ Mark student attendance (present/absent/late/excused)
- ✅ View attendance reports for their sessions
- ✅ Add notes to attendance records

**External Link Workflow**

- ✅ Click "إضافة رابط" (Add Link) → SessionLinkModal opens
- ✅ Paste Zoom/Meet/Teams URL

✅ GET /api/attendance?instructorId=[id] - View own session attendance
❌ DELETE /api/tracks - Cannot delete tracks
❌ GET /api/students - Cannot view all students
```

**Zustand State Management**:

```typescript
// Instructor dashboard uses centralized stores
useSessionStore(); // Fetch/update sessions
useTrackStore(); // Fetch tracks
useUIStore(); // Modal management
```

**External Link Validation**:

```typescript
import { canStartSession } from "@/lib/sessionValidation";

if (!canStartSession(session.externalLink)) {
  // Show error, auto-open link modal
  openModal("sessionLinkModal");
  return; // Prevent session start
}
```

**Critical Fix Applied** (Today):

- Modals were not rendering (buttons existed but did nothing)
- **Fixed**: Added `SessionLinkModal` and `AttendanceModal` components to JSX

## 🏗️ SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

### Academic Hierarchy (Core Domain)

```
Grade (صف) ← Students assigned here
  ↓
Track (مسار) ← Instructor + Coordinator assigned
  ↓
LiveSession (جلسة) ← Date, Time, ExternalLink, Status
  ↓
SessionAttendance (حضور) ← Per-student, per-session
```

**Example Data Flow**:

```
Grade: "المستوى الأول" (Level 1)
├── Track: "Web Development"
│   ├── Instructor: أحمد المعلم
│   ├── Coordinator: سارة المنسقة
│   └── Sessions: [12 sessions]
│       ├── Session 1: "HTML Basics" (COMPLETED)
│       ├── Session 2: "CSS Introduction" (ACTIVE) ← Students can join now
│       └── Session 3: "JavaScript Basics" (SCHEDULED)
└── Track: "أساسيات الحاسوب"
    └── ...
```

### External Session Coordination Workflow

**Platform Concept**: All sessions happen externally (Zoom/Meet/Teams)

```
1. DRAFT → Session created, no external link
2. SCHEDULED → Date/time set, still no link
3. READY → External link added (Zoom URL), ready to start
4. ACTIVE → Instructor clicks "Start", students can join
5. COMPLETED → Session ends, attendance can be marked
6. CANCELLED → Session was cancelled
```

**External Link Validation**:

```typescript
// Supported platforms
- Zoom: https://zoom.us/j/[meeting-id]
- Google Meet: https://meet.google.com/[room-code]
- Microsoft Teams: https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/...
- Any HTTPS URL (fallback)

// Validation happens at:
1. SessionLinkModal (real-time UI feedback)
2. API route (PUT /api/sessions/[id])
3. Session start (canStartSession() check)
```

### Database Schema Overview

**23 Models** organized in 3 categories:

**1. Authentication & Users (5 models)**

- `User` - All user types (student/instructor/coordinator/manager/ceo)
- `Account` - NextAuth.js OAuth accounts
- `Session` - NextAuth.js session tokens
- `VerificationToken` - Email verification
- `LearningStreak` - Student engagement tracking

**2. Academic Structure (5 models)**

- `Grade` - Academic levels (المستوى الأول-الرابع)
- `Track` - Subject-specific paths within grades
- `LiveSession` - External coordination sessions
- `SessionAttendance` - Per-student, per-session tracking
- `Course` - Traditional LMS courses (future use)

**3. LMS Features (13 models)**

- `Enrollment`, `CourseSession`, `Assignment`, `AssignmentSubmission`
- `Exam`, `Attendance`, `Certificate`, `Payment`, `Invoice`
- `SessionProgress`, `LearningActivity`, `ProgressMilestone`

### State Management Architecture

**Zustand Stores** (Centralized State):

```typescript
// 5 main stores
useUIStore(); // Modals, notifications, loading states
useSessionStore(); // LiveSession CRUD and filtering
useTrackStore(); // Track data management
useGradeStore(); // Grade hierarchy
useUserStore(); // User management
```

**Why Zustand?**

- ✅ No React Context boilerplate
- ✅ Automatic re-renders
- ✅ TypeScript-first
- ✅ Dev Tools integration
- ✅ Lightweight (3KB)

### API Architecture

**28 Route Files** organized by resource:

```
/api
├── /analytics (ceo, coordinator)
├── /attendance (CRUD + bulk operations)
├── /grades (CRUD)
├── /sessions (CRUD + status management)
├── /students (CRUD + grade assignment)
├── /tracks (CRUD)
└── /users (role-based filtering)
```

**Authentication Pattern** (Every API route):

```typescript
const session = await getServerSession(authOptions);
if (!session) return ErrorResponses.unauthorized();

// Role-based access control
const allowedRoles = ["manager", "ceo"];
if (!allowedRoles.includes(session.user.role)) {
  return ErrorResponses.forbidden();
}
```

---

## 💡 STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate Actions (This Week)

**1. Fix Build Errors** 🚨 **HIGHEST PRIORITY**

```bash
# Start here:
npx tsc --noEmit
# Fix one error at a time, starting with async params
```

**2. Deploy to Staging Environment**

```bash
# Even with build errors, deploy dev server to Vercel/Railway
# This lets stakeholders test in real environment
# URL: andrino-academy-staging.vercel.app
```

**3. Add Basic Real-Time Updates**

```typescript
// Student dashboard: 30-second polling
useEffect(() => {
  const interval = setInterval(fetchData, 30000);
  return () => clearInterval(interval);
}, []);
```

### Short-Term Improvements (1-2 Months)

**1. Payment Integration Priority**

- **Saudi Arabia Focus**: Use Moyasar or Tabby (local payment gateways)
- **Alternative**: Stripe (requires business verification)
- **Workflow**: Student requests enrollment → Pays → Manager receives notification → Manager assigns grade

**2. Materials System**

- **Option A**: Store in `/public/materials` folder (simple, limited)
- **Option B**: AWS S3 / Cloudflare R2 (scalable, professional)
- **Must-Have**: Upload progress bar, file type validation, virus scanning

**3. Email Notifications**

- **Service**: Resend (modern, affordable) or SendGrid (enterprise)
- **Critical Emails**:
  - Student: Grade assigned, session starting soon, attendance marked
  - Instructor: New track assigned, session reminder
  - Manager: New enrollment request, payment received

### Long-Term Enhancements (3-6 Months)

**1. Advanced Analytics Dashboard**

- Instructor performance metrics
- Student engagement scoring
- Predictive analytics (dropout risk)
- Revenue forecasting

**2. Mobile Application**

- React Native or Flutter
- Push notifications for session reminders
- Offline mode for viewing materials

**3. AI Features**

- Auto-generate session summaries
- Attendance prediction
- Personalized learning paths
- Chatbot for student support

---

## 🔐 SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS

### Currently Implemented ✅

1. **Authentication**: NextAuth.js with bcrypt password hashing
2. **Authorization**: Role-based middleware on all routes
3. **API Protection**: All endpoints check user role before processing
4. **SQL Injection**: Prisma ORM prevents SQL injection
5. **XSS Protection**: React escapes output by default
6. **CSRF Protection**: NextAuth.js CSRF tokens

### Still Needed ⚠️

1. **Rate Limiting**: Prevent brute force attacks
2. **Input Validation**: Zod/Yup schema validation
3. **File Upload Security**: Virus scanning, file type validation
4. **Audit Logging**: Track all CRUD operations
5. **Data Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive fields (parentPhone, address)
6. **HTTPS Enforcement**: Redirect HTTP → HTTPS in production

---

## 📈 SCALABILITY ANALYSIS

### Current Database (SQLite)

**Limits**:

- ✅ Development: Perfect
- ⚠️ Production: Up to 10,000 students (performance degrades after)
- ❌ High Traffic: Not suitable for concurrent writes

**Migration Path**:

```prisma
// Change datasource to PostgreSQL
datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}
```

**Recommended**: Migrate to PostgreSQL before 1,000 students

### API Performance

**Current**: Single Next.js server
**Bottleneck**: All requests go through one instance

**Scaling Strategy**:

1. **0-1,000 users**: Single Vercel instance (current)
2. **1,000-10,000 users**: Vercel auto-scaling + PostgreSQL
3. **10,000+ users**: Dedicated database + CDN + Load balancer

---

## 🧪 TESTING RECOMMENDATIONS

### Manual Testing (Current)

**Test Accounts Available**:

```
CEO: ceo@andrino-academy.com / Andrino2024!

Coordinator: coordinator@andrino-academy.com / Coord2024!
Instructor: ahmed.instructor@andrino-academy.com / Instructor123!
Student: ali.student@andrino-academy.com / Student123!
```

### Automated Testing (Needed)

**Priority Tests to Add**:

1. **API Tests** (Jest + Supertest)

```typescript
describe("POST /api/sessions", () => {
  it("should require valid external link before starting", async () => {
    const response = await request(app)
      .put("/api/sessions/123")
      .send({ status: "ACTIVE" });
    expect(response.status).toBe(400);
  });
});
```
