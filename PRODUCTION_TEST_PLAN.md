### Test Case S1: Role-Based Access Control

**Priority**: 🔴 CRITICAL

**Steps**:

1. Login as Student
2. Attempt to access:
   - ❌ Manager dashboard → Should block
   - ❌ Instructor session creation → Should block
   - ❌ CEO analytics → Should block
   - ✅ Own dashboard → Should allow
3. Try direct API calls:
   - `GET /api/users` → Should return 403
   - `POST /api/sessions` → Should return 403
4. Repeat for each role
5. Verify permission matrix:
   - Students: Read own data only
   - Instructors: Manage own sessions
   - Coordinators: Oversee assigned tracks
   - Managers: Manage academics
   - CEO: View all

**Expected Results**:

   - Delete track with sessions → Should handle
   - Delete session with attendance → Should handle
3. Verify:
   - ✅ Proper cascade or prevent
   - ✅ No orphaned records
   - ✅ Foreign keys enforced
4. Test orphan prevention:
   - Cannot create session without track
   - Cannot assign student without grade
   - Cannot mark attendance without session

**Expected Results**:

3. Simulate data loss/corruption
4. Restore from backup
5. Verify:
   - ✅ All original data restored
   - ✅ New data lost (expected)
   - ✅ System functional post-restore
6. Test incremental backup:
   - Backup A → Add data → Backup B
   - Restore B → Verify includes new data

**Expected Results**:

- Backup succeeds
- Restore works
- System functional
- No corruption

**Pass Criteria**: Backup/restore reliable, no data loss
