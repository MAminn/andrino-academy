# Andrino Academy - System Status & Production Readiness

## 📋 Current System Overview

### ✅ **Track Instructor/Coordinator Assignment - WORKING**

The system **already supports** instructor/coordinator assignments and they are **fully functional**:

#### How It Works:

1. **Manager assigns** instructors and coordinators to tracks via the advanced grade management interface
2. **API filters automatically** show only relevant tracks:
   - **Instructors** see only tracks where `instructorId` matches their ID
   - **Coordinators** see only tracks where `coordinatorId` matches their ID
3. **Sessions inherit** track assignments - sessions belong to tracks, tracks have instructors

#### API Implementation (`/api/tracks`):

```typescript
// For instructors, only show their own tracks
if (session.user.role === "instructor") {
  whereClause.instructorId = session.user.id;
}

// For coordinators, only show tracks they coordinate
if (session.user.role === "coordinator") {
  whereClause.coordinatorId = session.user.id;
}
```

**Status**: ✅ **FULLY OPERATIONAL** - Assignments made in manager dashboard immediately reflect in instructor/coordinator dashboards

## 📚 Course Management & Student Learning Journey

### Academic Structure:

```
Grade (المستوى الأول-الرابع)
  └── Track (مسار - e.g., "مسار الرياضيات")
       ├── Instructor (assigned)
       ├── Coordinator (assigned)
       └── Live Sessions (جلسات)
            ├── Date & Time
            ├── External Meeting Link (Zoom/Meet/Teams)
            ├── Status (Draft → Scheduled → Ready → Active → Completed)
            └── Session Attendance (for each student)
```

### Student Learning Journey:

#### 1. **Enrollment Phase**

- ✅ Manager assigns student to a **Grade** (e.g., "المستوى الأول")
- ✅ Student automatically sees all **Tracks** in that grade
- ✅ Each track shows instructor, session count, and progress

#### 2. **Session Access Phase**

- ✅ Student views **upcoming sessions** across all tracks in their grade
- ✅ Sessions show:
  - Track name
  - Instructor name
  - Date and time
  - Status (scheduled, active, completed)
- ✅ When session is **ACTIVE**, student can join via external link

#### 3. **Learning Tracking Phase**

- ✅ Attendance is marked per session
- ✅ Student can view:
  - Total sessions in their grade
  - Sessions attended
  - Attendance rate percentage
  - Completed vs upcoming sessions

#### 4. **Progress Monitoring**

- ✅ Track-level progress shows:
  - Total sessions per track
  - Completed sessions
  - Next upcoming session
- ✅ Grade-level overview shows overall progress

### Current Session Workflow:

```
[Manager/Coordinator] Creates Session → DRAFT status
         ↓
[Instructor] Schedules date/time → SCHEDULED status
         ↓
[Instructor] Adds external link → READY status
         ↓
[Instructor] Starts session → ACTIVE status
         ↓
[Students] Join via external link (Zoom/Meet/Teams)
         ↓
[Instructor] Marks attendance during/after session
         ↓
[Instructor] Completes session → COMPLETED status
```

## 🔗 Instructor-Student Relationship

### Direct Connections:

1. **Instructor → Track** (via `instructorId` in Track model)
2. **Track → Grade** (via `gradeId` in Track model)
3. **Student → Grade** (via `gradeId` in User model where role='student')

### Indirect Relationships:

- **Instructor sees Students** in their grade(s) via track assignments
- **Students see Instructor** name and info on track cards
- **Attendance links** instructor-led sessions to specific students

### Data Flow:

```
Instructor Dashboard:
  ├── My Tracks (where instructorId = my ID)
  ├── Today's Sessions (from my tracks)
  ├── Students in My Grades (via track → grade → students)
  └── Session Management (CRUD operations)

Student Dashboard:
  ├── My Grade (assigned by manager)
  ├── Available Tracks (all tracks in my grade)
  ├── Track Details (instructor name visible)
  ├── Upcoming Sessions (from all tracks in my grade)
  └── Join Active Sessions (via external links)
```
